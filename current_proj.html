                            We are interested in seeing if diet composition across different stages of life impact the formation of colon cancer in mice. The diets that we are testing are a control mouse diet for an experimental control, a high-fat diet to mimic the diets found in the more developed nations, and a calorie (energy)-restricted diet to mimic the diets found in the still developing nations. My contributions to this project lie more in the data analysis / computational biology space through the use of the R statistical programming language.

                        GOS Project
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            We are also interested in seeing if supplementing diets with a prebiotic like galactooligosaccharides (GOS) is able to impact the digestive bacteriome and metabolome. GOS supplementation has been shown previously to reduce the amount of anxiety in mice. We are hoping that prebiotic supplementation will be anti-inflammatory and thus able to be used in diseases where inflammation is a driving force, such as Crohn's Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and colorectal cancer (CRC).

                            The current projects I am working on right now in my extremely limited freetime mainly involve either working on improving my skillset (such as creating this website for the sole purpose of learning HTML and CSS), or building programs to help with my work as a bacteriologist using either R or Python.

                            Lately though I've been wanting to branch out more and begin learning Java or rekindling my love-hate relationship with the rage inducing C++. But honestly I don't really have any good ideas on what software would be beneficial to build. So if you have any sugestions, and they turn out to actually be reasonable, let me know and I just might turn your idea into a functional piece of software.
