                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My name is <b><u>Kyle Spencer</u></b> and I am a compuational bacteriologist at the NIH.
                    I am also a PhD Student in Computational Biology at The Ohio State University.
                    My research focuses on how environmental factors such as diet and stress impact the bacteriome and metabolome in the digestive system and how these changes impact gut epithelial integrity.

                    Education
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I received a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Biomedical Sciences from Central Michigan University in 2016. 
                    I also received a Master of Science (MS) degree in Biology from Central Michigan University in 2018. 
                    During my time as a graduate student at CMU I completed a thesis entitled "Identifying the Actin Binding Sites Within the VcRTXA Actin Crosslinking Domain of <i>Vibrio cholerae in vitro</i>."
                    I joined the BSGP Program at Ohio State in 2018 to complete my PhD in Computational Biology after joining the lab of Dr. Ewy Mathé.
                    During my time in the Mathé lab I have learned a great deal about metabolomics and data analysis using R. 
                    It was during this time when I was awarded a position with NCATS as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow through the Graduate Partnership Program (GPP) at the NIH.

                    Other Interests
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am interested in programming, both for work and as a hobby, and have experience in:
                <dl>
                    <dt>Statistical Analysis (R & RStudio)</dt>
                    <dt>Programming (Python, R, amd C++)</dt>
                    <dt>Web Design (HTML & CSS)</dt>
                </dl>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My other hobby lies in the field of numismatics, also known as coin collecting. I mainly specialize in European coins with a focus on Pre-WW2 coins from the German States of Prussia, Bavaria, and Saxony.
