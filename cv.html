                        I was awarded a place in the Graduate Partnership Program through the National Center for the Advancement of Translational Sciences through the National Institutes of Health. This allows me to complete the rest of my dissertation research at the NIH and remain a doctoral student at The Ohio State University allowing me to grow my professional network and to take advantage of the incredible facilities and equipment that can only be found at the NIH.

                        I am currently working on my PhD in the labs of Dr. Ewy Mathé and Dr. Michael Bailey at Ohio State. We are investigating the role of bacteriome and metabolome alterations and their impact on gut epithelial integrity and looking for distinct biological pathways that fluctuate based on these omics alterations.

                        I completed my master’s degree in the lab of Dr. Stephen Juris looking into the VcRTXA toxin of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. We hoped to identify the actin binding mofits within the Actin Cross-linking Domain (ACD) of the toxin in hopes of eventually developing small molecule inhibitors to prevent the toxin from functioning.
